This study systematically quantified nitrogen and phosphorus runoff losses under simulated extreme rainfall in eucalyptus forest soils amended with sewage sludge. The study identified sludge application rate and rainfall intensity as key drivers of nutrient runoff and recommended safe thresholds for sustainable management.
