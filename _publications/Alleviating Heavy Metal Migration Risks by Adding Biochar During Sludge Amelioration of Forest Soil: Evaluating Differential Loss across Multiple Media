title: "Alleviating Heavy Metal Migration Risks by Adding Biochar During Sludge Amelioration of Forest Soil: Evaluating Differential Loss across Multiple Media"
collection: publications
category: unpublished
status: ' Revision of Journal of Hazardous Materials'
authors: 'Third author'
excerpt: 'This study uses field-simulated rainfall experiments in eucalyptus plantations to evaluate how co-applying sewage sludge with different feedstock-derived biochars regulates multi-media heavy metal (especially Cd) migration via surface runoff, interflow, and sediment. By linking soil structure–hydrology–speciation processes with ecological risk indices (WQI, RI, PLI), it identifies sludge-derived biochar as the most effective amendment and highlights interflow as a hidden high-risk pathway that must be monitored in sludge land-application policy.'
