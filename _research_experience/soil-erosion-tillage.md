**Position:** Visiting Research Student

**Supervisors:** Xianli Xu, Xuezhang Li

**Duration:** November 2019 – June 2021

**Project Description:** Evaluated the effects of Deep Vertical Rotary Tillage (DVRT) on soil erosion, aggregate stability, and nutrient loss in sugarcane cultivation systems.

## Technical Development

### Rainfall Simulation Device
- Designed and constructed a portable rainfall simulation device capable of producing uniform rainfall intensities (30–120 mm/h) over 2 m² plots
- Calibrated and validated the device, achieving Christiansen uniformity coefficient >85%

### Field Experiments
- Led a one-month intensive field campaign, completing 20 rainfall simulation events with two undergraduate assistants
- Designed factorial experiments comparing DVRT with conventional tillage across multiple no-tillage periods (1–5 years)

## Laboratory Analysis

### Soil Physical Properties
- Quantified water-stable aggregate distribution using wet-sieving method
- Measured soil penetration resistance and compaction profiles
- Characterized saturated hydraulic conductivity and infiltration rates

### Soil Chemical Analysis
- Analyzed free iron (Fed), amorphous iron (Feo), and aluminum oxides as indicators of aggregate binding
- Fractionated soil organic carbon into labile, slow, and passive pools using acid hydrolysis and density separation

### Erosion and Nutrient Loss
- Quantified runoff initiation time, peak discharge, and total runoff volume under varying rainfall intensities
- Monitored NO₃⁻-N and NH₄⁺-N concentrations in runoff
- Quantified dissolved and particulate phosphorus and organic carbon losses

## Key Findings

- DVRT reduced soil erosion over the long term but increased erosion in the initial period after tillage
- Identified aggregate stability changes across different tillage durations as a key mechanism controlling erosion response
