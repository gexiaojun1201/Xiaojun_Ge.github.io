**Position:** Project-based Research Student / Visiting Student  
**Supervisors:** Xianli Xu, Xuezhang Li  
**Duration:** November 2019 - June 2021
**Project Description:** This research pioneered the evaluation of Deep Vertical Rotary Tillage (DVRT) as an innovative soil management technique for sugarcane cultivation, focusing on its impacts on soil erosion, nutrient dynamics, and hydrological processes.



## Technical Innovation

### Rainfall Simulation Device Development


- **Engineering Design:** Engineered and constructed a portable rainfall simulation device capable of producing uniform rainfall intensities (30-120 mm/h) over 2m² plots
- **Calibration and Validation:** Achieved Christiansen uniformity coefficient >85% through innovative nozzle design and pressure regulation
- **Field Deployment:** Successfully deployed the device across 15 field sites with varying soil types and slopes (5-25°)

### Experimental Design and Implementation


- **Comparative Studies:** Designed factorial experiments comparing DVRT with conventional tillage across multiple no-tillage periods (1-5 years)
- **Field Trials:** Implemented two-month intensive field campaign with team of graduate students, completing over 100 rainfall simulation events
- **Quality Control:** Established rigorous QA/QC protocols ensuring data reliability and reproducibility

## Soil Physical and Chemical Analysis

### Soil Structural Stability Assessment


- **Aggregate Analysis:** Quantified water-stable aggregate distribution using wet-sieving method, revealing 30% improvement in macro-aggregate stability under DVRT
- **Penetration Resistance:** Measured soil compaction profiles showing reduced subsurface compaction (20-40 cm depth) with DVRT treatment
- **Hydraulic Properties:** Characterized saturated hydraulic conductivity, water retention curves, and infiltration rates

### Sesquioxides and Carbon Fractions


- **Iron and Aluminum Oxides:** Analyzed free iron (Fed), amorphous iron (Feo), and aluminum oxides as indicators of soil weathering and aggregate binding agents
- **Organic Carbon Pools:** Fractionated soil organic carbon into labile, slow, and passive pools using acid hydrolysis and density separation
- **Carbon Stabilization:** Investigated organo-mineral associations and their role in carbon sequestration under different tillage systems

## Erosion and Nutrient Loss Quantification

### Runoff and Sediment Analysis


- **Erosion Rates:** Quantified soil loss rates ranging from 0.5-15 t/ha per event, with DVRT reducing erosion by 40-60% compared to conventional tillage
- **Runoff Characteristics:** Analyzed runoff initiation time, peak discharge, and total runoff volume under varying rainfall intensities
- **Sediment Properties:** Characterized particle size distribution and enrichment ratios of eroded sediments

### Nutrient Leaching and Loss Assessment


- **Nitrogen Dynamics:** Monitored NO₃⁻-N and NH₄⁺-N concentrations in runoff and leachate, identifying critical loss periods
- **Phosphorus Transport:** Quantified dissolved and particulate phosphorus losses, with focus on bioavailable P fractions
- **Carbon Export:** Measured dissolved and particulate organic carbon losses, contributing to watershed carbon budget assessments

## Research Outcomes and Impact

- **Erosion Reduction:** Demonstrated that DVRT reduced annual soil loss by 45% while maintaining crop productivity
- **Nutrient Retention:** Showed 35% reduction in nitrogen losses and 40% reduction in phosphorus losses under DVRT
- **Water Conservation:** Documented 25% increase in soil water storage capacity in the root zone (0-60 cm)
- **Practical Applications:** Results adopted by local agricultural extension services for sugarcane production guidelines

## Methodological Innovations

- Developed novel protocol for simultaneous collection of surface runoff and subsurface flow
- Created predictive models for erosion risk assessment under different tillage scenarios
- Established long-term monitoring plots for continued evaluation of DVRT impacts

## Collaborative Achievements


- Worked with interdisciplinary team including soil scientists, hydrologists, and agronomists
- Contributed to regional soil erosion assessment for Guangxi Province
- Provided technical support for sustainable intensification of sugarcane production systems
