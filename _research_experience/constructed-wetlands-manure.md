**Position:** Collaboratively Trained Student  
**Supervisors:** Zaijian Yuan, Xiaomin Li  
**Duration:** September 2020 - June 2022<br>
**Project Description:** This research focused on developing ecological treatment solutions for swine farm wastewater using constructed wetlands, with emphasis on understanding nitrogen transformation processes under antibiotic exposure.



## Major Research Achievements

### Mesocosm Wetland Studies


- **System Design and Construction:** Led the design and establishment of mesocosm surface flow constructed wetlands featuring *Myriophyllum elatinoides* for controlled experimental studies
- **Antibiotic Impact Assessment:** Conducted comprehensive studies on the effects of veterinary antibiotics on nitrogen removal efficiency, revealing critical thresholds for wetland performance
- **Isotope Tracing Studies:** Utilized ¹⁵N isotope labeling techniques to quantify gross nitrogen transformation rates and identify key nitrogen cycling pathways under antibiotic stress

### Field-Scale Implementation


- **Full-Scale Wetland Development:** Participated in the design and construction of field-scale surface flow constructed wetlands covering 2,000 m²
- **Operation and Maintenance:** Managed day-to-day operations including plant harvesting schedules, hydraulic loading optimization, and seasonal maintenance protocols
- **Performance Monitoring:** Established comprehensive monitoring programs for water quality parameters, sediment characteristics, and treatment efficiency evaluation

## Advanced Research Techniques

### Molecular Biology Applications


- **Microbial Community Analysis:** Applied high-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing) to characterize microbial community shifts under long-term antibiotic exposure
- **Functional Gene Quantification:** Employed qPCR techniques to quantify nitrogen cycling genes (amoA, nirS, nirK, nosZ) and antibiotic resistance genes
- **Bioinformatics Analysis:** Performed statistical analysis of microbial diversity indices and functional prediction using PICRUSt2 and FAPROTAX

### Environmental Monitoring


- **Water Quality Analysis:** Conducted routine monitoring of NH₄⁺-N, NO₃⁻-N, NO₂⁻-N, TN, TP, COD, and dissolved oxygen levels
- **Antibiotic Residue Detection:** Analyzed veterinary antibiotic concentrations using LC-MS/MS techniques
- **Sediment Characterization:** Assessed sediment accumulation rates, organic matter content, and nutrient storage capacity

## Research Impact and Outcomes

- Revealed that sustained antibiotic exposure (>30 days) significantly reduced nitrogen removal efficiency by 35-40%
- Identified key microbial taxa responsible for maintaining nitrogen removal under antibiotic stress
- Developed operational guidelines for constructed wetland management in the presence of emerging contaminants
- Contributed to provincial non-point source pollution assessment database for Guangdong Province

## Additional Project Contributions


- **Lian River Water Environment Project (Aug 2021 - Mar 2022):** Assessed ecological management strategies for river water quality improvement
- **Biochar Amendment Studies (Aug 2020 - Mar 2021):** Investigated the effects of biochar on cadmium mobilization in red soil under simulated rainfall erosion
