**Position:** Graduate Research Student (M.S. Thesis Research)
**Supervisors:** Zaijian Yuan, Xiaomin Li
**Duration:** September 2020 – June 2022<br>
**Project Description:** Investigated nitrogen cycling processes in constructed wetlands treating swine farm wastewater, with focus on microbial-mediated nitrogen transformations under antibiotic stress.

## Core Research (M.S. Thesis)

### Mesocosm Experiment System
- Designed and operated mesocosm surface flow constructed wetlands with *Myriophyllum elatinoides* to study antibiotic effects on nitrogen removal
- Conducted ¹⁵N isotope labeling experiments to quantify gross nitrogen transformation rates, including mineralization, nitrification, and denitrification pathways
- Performed DNA extraction and bioinformatic analysis of 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing data (PICRUSt2, FAPROTAX) to characterize microbial community shifts and functional responses

### Analytical Skills Applied
- Routine water quality monitoring (NH₄⁺-N, NO₃⁻-N, NO₂⁻-N, TN, COD, DO)
- Sample preparation for LC-MS/MS antibiotic residue analysis and qPCR quantification of nitrogen cycling genes

## Field Support Work

- Participated in construction and maintenance of a 2,000 m² field-scale constructed wetland, including plant management, hydraulic system upkeep, and water quality sampling

## Publications

- **[First Author]** Sediment nitrogen transformation rates in constructed wetlands under antibiotic exposure: a ¹⁵N isotope tracing study. *Manuscript in preparation*
- **[First Author]** Long-term performance and microbial community dynamics in constructed wetlands treating swine wastewater. *Manuscript in preparation*

## Additional Project Involvement

- Contributed to Lian River water environment assessment and biochar-soil interaction studies as part of broader research group activities
