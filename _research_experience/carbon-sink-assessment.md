**Position:** Research Assistant  
**Supervisors:** Shubin Li, Ge Ren  
**Duration:** November 2022 - Present<br>
**Project Description:** This ongoing research focuses on developing a high-resolution (1 km × 1 h) carbon sink assessment system for eucalyptus plantations in Guangxi, integrating ground-based flux monitoring, remote sensing, and Bayesian inversion approaches to support regional carbon trading and policy implementation.

## Key Contributions

### Field Operations and Monitoring Infrastructure
- **Site Reconnaissance:** Conducted field surveys and stakeholder coordination for flux tower site selection across eucalyptus plantation areas
- **Instrument Operation:** Operated and maintained carbon flux monitoring systems including eddy covariance towers and Picarro G2401 cavity ring-down greenhouse gas analyzers
- **Data Acquisition:** Managed continuous data collection from monitoring networks, ensuring data quality and long-term system reliability

### Field Sampling and Data Processing
- **Ground-truthing Campaigns:** Performed regular field sampling for soil carbon, plant biomass, and litterfall measurements across plantation sites of varying ages
- **Data Processing:** Processed and quality-controlled carbon flux and concentration datasets for model validation
- **3D Site Visualization:** Developed UAV-based photogrammetric models using DJI Terra and Bentley ContextCapture for monitoring site documentation and spatial analysis

### Research Outputs and Standards Development
- **Lead Author:** Primary writer for research manuscript on carbon sink quantification methodologies (in preparation)
- **Proposal Development:** Contributed to project proposal writing, supporting acquisition of ¥100,000 preliminary research funding
- **Standards Participation:** Participated in developing regional technical standards for plantation carbon measurement

## Technical Skills Acquired
- Flux monitoring instrumentation (eddy covariance systems, cavity ring-down spectroscopy)
- UAV photogrammetry and 3D reconstruction (DJI Terra, ContextCapture)
- Fundamentals of atmospheric transport modeling (WRF-STILT) and Bayesian inversion methods
- Carbon budget assessment integrating multiple carbon pools

## Prior Related Work
### Carbon Economics Assessment (Before November 2024)
- Conducted preliminary assessment of economic pathways for plantation carbon sink realization in Guangxi province
- Collaborated with government agencies on carbon peak and carbon neutrality policy frameworks
