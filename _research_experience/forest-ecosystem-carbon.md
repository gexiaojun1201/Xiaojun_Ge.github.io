**Position:** Research Student

**Supervisors:** Zaijian Yuan, Xiaomin Li

**Duration:** May 2020 – December 2021

**Project Description:** Investigated soil carbon dynamics and microbial nutrient cycling along altitudinal gradients (300m – 1,900m) in subtropical montane forests.

## Field Work

- Participated in establishing permanent soil monitoring plots across five altitudinal zones, from plot layout to initial sampling
- Conducted quarterly soil sampling campaigns over 18 months to capture seasonal variations in carbon and nutrient dynamics

## Laboratory Analysis (Team-based)

### Soil Carbon Fractionation
- Physical fractionation: separated soil organic carbon into particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM)
- Chemical analysis: dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and hot water extractable carbon (HWEC)

### Soil Biogeochemistry
- Physicochemical properties: pH, texture, bulk density, aggregate stability
- Nutrient cycling: nitrogen mineralization rates, available phosphorus, exchangeable cations
- Extracellular enzyme activities related to C, N, and P cycling

### Microbial Analysis
- Microbial biomass C, N, P quantification via chloroform fumigation-extraction
- Phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiling for microbial community composition

## Publication

- **[Fourth Author]** Soil organic carbon fractionation along altitudinal gradients in subtropical montane forests. *Published*

## Skills Developed

- Field sampling in montane terrain across elevation gradients
- Soil carbon fractionation and biogeochemical analysis techniques
- Microbial community characterization methods (PLFA)
