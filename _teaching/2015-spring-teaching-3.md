## Project Overview
Investigation of the hydrological and ecological responses to Deep Vertical Rotary Tillage (DVRT) method in sugarcane cultivation systems under simulated rainfall conditions.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

### Experimental Infrastructure Development
* **Engineered and constructed a portable rainfall simulation device** enabling controlled experiments under field conditions
* Device specifications:
  - Adjustable rainfall intensity and duration
  - Uniform spatial distribution across test plots
  - Deployed for multiple hydrological research projects

### Field Experiment Implementation
* **Led two-month field campaign** conducting rainfall simulations across experimental plots with graduate student team
* Compared DVRT versus conventional tillage across multiple no-tillage recovery periods
* Collected runoff and sediment samples for comprehensive laboratory analysis

### Soil Quality Assessment
* Analyzed **soil structural stability** parameters:
  - Aggregate size distribution and water stability
  - Bulk density and porosity changes
  - Infiltration capacity

* Characterized **sesquioxide (Fe/Al oxides) distribution**:
  - Free iron and aluminum oxides
  - Poorly crystalline oxide forms
  - Role in soil aggregate binding

* Evaluated **soil organic carbon fractions**:
  - Particulate organic carbon (POC)
  - Mineral-associated organic carbon (MAOC)
  - Dissolved organic carbon (DOC)

### Erosion Dynamics & Nutrient Loss Quantification
* **Quantitatively assessed soil erosion risk** under DVRT management:
  - Sediment yield under varying rainfall intensities
  - Temporal patterns of erosion during events

* **Measured nutrient leaching and surface losses**:
  - Nitrogen (NH₄⁺-N, NO₃⁻-N, Total N)
  - Phosphorus (Dissolved P, Particulate P)
  - Potassium and other essential nutrients

* Provided mechanistic understanding of how tillage depth and method influence:
  - Hydrological connectivity and runoff generation
  - Nutrient cycling and retention capacity
  - Long-term soil quality under intensive sugarcane cultivation

## Scientific Contributions
* Demonstrated that DVRT can reduce surface erosion while potentially increasing subsurface nutrient leaching
* Identified optimal no-tillage recovery periods following DVRT implementation
* Provided data-driven recommendations for sustainable sugarcane production in subtropical regions

## Technical Skills Applied
* Rainfall simulation equipment design
* Field-scale hydrological monitoring
* Soil physical and chemical analysis
* Nutrient quantification (colorimetry, ion chromatography)
* Statistical analysis for paired treatment comparisons
