**Duration:** May 2020 - December 2021

This research investigated soil carbon dynamics and microbial nutrient cycling along altitudinal gradients in subtropical montane forests, contributing to understanding of climate change impacts on forest carbon storage.

## Research Focus Areas

### Altitudinal Gradient Studies
======

- **Plot Establishment:** Participated in establishing permanent soil monitoring plots across five altitudinal zones (300m - 1,900m elevation)
- **Seasonal Sampling Campaigns:** Conducted quarterly soil sampling over 18 months to capture seasonal variations in carbon and nutrient dynamics
- **Environmental Monitoring:** Installed and maintained data loggers for continuous monitoring of soil temperature, moisture, and microclimate conditions

### Soil Carbon Fractionation Analysis
======

- **Physical Fractionation:** Separated soil organic carbon into particulate organic matter (POM) and mineral-associated organic matter (MAOM) fractions
- **Chemical Characterization:** Analyzed dissolved organic carbon (DOC), microbial biomass carbon (MBC), and hot water extractable carbon (HWEC)
- **Stability Assessment:** Evaluated carbon stability indices and mean residence times across different forest types and elevations

## Biogeochemical Investigations

### Soil Property Characterization
======

- **Physicochemical Analysis:** Comprehensive assessment of soil pH, texture, bulk density, and aggregate stability
- **Nutrient Cycling:** Quantified nitrogen mineralization rates, available phosphorus, and exchangeable cations
- **Enzyme Activities:** Measured extracellular enzyme activities related to C, N, and P cycling

### Microbial Community Dynamics
======

- **Biomass Quantification:** Determined microbial biomass C, N, and P using chloroform fumigation-extraction method
- **Community Structure:** Analyzed phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) profiles to characterize microbial community composition
- **Functional Relationships:** Investigated correlations between microbial communities and soil carbon fractions

## Key Research Findings
======

- **Elevation Effects:** Documented 45% increase in soil organic carbon stocks from 300m to 1,500m elevation, with declining trends above treeline
- **Temperature Sensitivity:** Revealed higher temperature sensitivity (Q10) of soil respiration at higher elevations, indicating vulnerability to warming
- **Microbial Controls:** Identified shifts from bacteria-dominated to fungi-dominated communities with increasing elevation
- **Seasonal Patterns:** Characterized distinct seasonal patterns in labile carbon fractions, with peaks during the growing season

## Methodological Contributions
======

- Developed standardized protocols for soil sampling in steep montane terrain
- Optimized extraction methods for soil carbon fractions in highly weathered subtropical soils
- Created comprehensive database linking soil properties, carbon fractions, and microbial parameters

## Research Applications
======

- Results contributed to regional carbon budget assessments for Guangdong Province
- Data incorporated into process-based models for predicting forest carbon dynamics under climate change scenarios
- Findings informed forest management strategies for enhancing carbon sequestration in subtropical forests
