## Project Overview
Technology integration and demonstration of ecological treatment for swine farm manure pollution, focusing on antibiotic impacts on wetland nitrogen removal efficiency.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

### Experimental System Development
* **Designed and established mesocosm-scale surface flow constructed wetlands** featuring *Myriophyllum elatinoides* for controlled antibiotic exposure experiments
* Participated in **field-scale constructed wetland design and construction**, responsible for:
  - Plant establishment and biomass harvesting protocols
  - Water quality and sediment monitoring systems
  - Operational maintenance and troubleshooting

### Mechanistic Studies with Advanced Techniques
* **Quantified nitrogen gross transformation rates** under varying antibiotic exposure scenarios using <sup>15</sup>N isotope tracing techniques
* Simulated antibiotic effects across different:
  - Exposure durations (acute vs. chronic)
  - Concentration gradients (environmentally relevant levels)
  - Seasonal conditions

### Molecular Biology & Microbial Analysis
* Employed **high-throughput sequencing** and **qPCR** to characterize microbial community responses to long-term antibiotic stress
* Revealed shifts in nitrogen-cycling functional gene abundances (*nirS*, *nirK*, *nosZ*, *amoA*)
* Linked microbial community changes to nitrogen removal pathway alterations

### Long-term Monitoring Campaign
* Conducted routine monitoring to assess sustained antibiotic exposure impacts on:
  - Overall nitrogen removal efficiency
  - Dominant nitrogen transformation pathways (nitrification, denitrification)
  - Wetland treatment performance stability

## Additional Project Contributions
* **Lian River Water Environment Ecological Management Project** (Aug 2021 - Mar 2022)
* **Biochar Effects on Cadmium Loss under Rainfall Erosion** (Aug 2020 - Mar 2021)
* Conducted preliminary surveys on agricultural non-point source pollution across Guangdong Province

## Technical Skills Applied
* Constructed wetland design and operation
* <sup>15</sup>N isotope tracing techniques
* High-throughput sequencing (16S rRNA, functional genes)
* Quantitative PCR (qPCR)
* Water quality analysis and nutrient quantification
