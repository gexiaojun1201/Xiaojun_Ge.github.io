## Project Overview
Development and validation of a high-resolution carbon sink assessment system for eucalyptus plantations based on temporal and spatial monitoring techniques.

## Key Responsibilities & Achievements

### Experimental Design & Field Work
* Led field sampling campaigns for soil, plant biomass, and litterfall collection across plantation sites
* Maintained and operated eddy covariance systems and automated chamber measurements for carbon flux monitoring
* Processed and calculated carbon sink estimates from multi-source flux data

### Data Integration & Modeling
* **Integrated multi-scale carbon monitoring data** (plot-level measurements, eddy covariance, remote sensing) to validate and calibrate carbon sink models
* **Applied machine learning approaches** to optimize model parameters and improve prediction accuracy across different temporal and spatial scales
* Conducted comparative analysis of carbon sink quantification methods at different monitoring scales

### Project Management & Funding
* **Secured ¥200,000 project funding** by developing comprehensive assessment framework combining empirical analysis, ML-driven modeling, and policy evaluation
* Evaluated pathways for economic realization of plantation carbon sinks under China's carbon neutrality framework
* Collaborated with team members (Shubin Li, Qiang An, Ge Ren) on technical implementation and reporting

## Technical Skills Applied
* Carbon flux measurement and calculation
* Machine learning for ecological modeling
* Multi-scale data integration and validation
* Statistical analysis in R and Python
