Research Experience
======

### Nitrogen and Phosphorus Runoff from Forest Soils (2024-2025)
* **Focus**: Nutrient loss pathways and ecological risk assessment in sludge-amended eucalyptus plantations
* **Key findings**: Quantified N and P transport via surface runoff, interflow, and sediment under extreme rainfall; identified particle-size-dependent enrichment patterns
* **Publication**: Yang et al. (2025), *CATENA* (co-First author)

### Agricultural Carbon Budget Assessment (2023-2024)
* **Focus**: Long-term agricultural carbon emissions, sequestration, and net carbon sink dynamics in Guangxi Province
* **Key findings**: Quantified 43-year agricultural carbon budget trends; identified crop yield and fertilizer management as dominant drivers
* **Publication**: Ge et al. (2024), *Chinese Journal of Eco-Agriculture* (First author)

### Agricultural Non-Point Source Pollution (2021-2022)
* **Focus**: Spatial-temporal patterns and source apportionment of agricultural pollution in Guangdong Province
* **Key findings**: Characterized 20-year pollution load dynamics; identified livestock breeding and aquaculture as major contributors
* **Publication**: Ge et al. (2022), *Environmental Science* (First author)

### Heavy Metal Migration and Biochar Remediation (2021-2022)
* **Focus**: Cadmium loss characteristics and biochar immobilization effects under simulated rainfall
* **Key findings**: Evaluated biochar efficacy in reducing Cd availability and runoff/sediment-borne loss
* **Publication**: Yuan et al. (2022), *Environmental Science and Pollution Research* (Fourth author)

### Ongoing Research Projects
* Antibiotic effects on nitrogen transformation processes in constructed wetland sediments (Manuscript in preparation, First author)
